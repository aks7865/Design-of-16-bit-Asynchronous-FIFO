# Design of Asynchronous FIFO
In asynchronous FIFO, data read and write operations use different clock frequencies. Since write and read clocks are not synchronized, it is referred to as asynchronous FIFO. Usually, these are used in systems where data need to pass from one clock domain to another which is generally termed as ‘clock domain crossing’.
Efforts to synchronize multiple signals from one clock domain to a new clock domain, ensuring the synchronization of all these signals in the new domain, has proven to be problematic. In designs, First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structures are used in designs to securely transfer multi-bit data chunks from one clock domain to other. These data chunks are inserted into a FIFO buffer memory array through control signals in one clock domain, and the removal of data chunks occurs through another port of the same FIFO buffer memory array using control signals from a different clock domain. 
The challenges associated with FIFO design arise primarily from devising the FIFO pointers and identifying a dependable method for ascertaining the "full" and "empty" status of the FIFO.
